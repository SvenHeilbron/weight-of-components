# weight-of-components
A excel file with as many components and their weight as possible. The file shows where the mass of the particular component has been found. (inventor, manuals, measured with a scale, etc.)
All the components are divided in different groups and subgroups, which makes it easier to find a specific component.
Best would be if all the components would be measured, but since a lot of components are in the car already, it is not easy to measure them individually. 
At the end of the file there is an estimation of the cars weight made on 26-11-2015. The file overall is far from finished.
